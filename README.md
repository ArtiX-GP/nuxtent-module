# Nuxt-Content

`nuxt-content` facilitates the usage of markdown files in content heavy sites.
It does this first, by compiling all the data from markdown files based on configured rules and second, by providing helper methods for dynamically accessing this data inside Nuxt pages.

Best of all, since Nuxt is already great, `nuxt-content` is a lightweight abstraction that does as little work as possible. :)

## Installation

```
npm install nuxt-content

```

Then, under `nuxt.config.js` install the module:

```
modules: [
   '@nuxtjs/content'
 ]
```
