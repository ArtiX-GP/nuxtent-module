# Nuxt-Content

Nuxt-Content facilitates the usage of markdown files in content heavy sites.
It does this by first, compiling all the data from markdown files based on configured rules and second, providing helper methods for dynamically accessing this data.

Best of all, it's a lightweight abstraction that does as little work as possible, since Nuxt is already great. :)

## Installation

```
npm install nuxt-content

```

Then, under `nuxt.config.js` install the module:

```
modules: [
   '@nuxtjs/content'
 ]
```
