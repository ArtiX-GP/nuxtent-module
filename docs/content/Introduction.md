There are two main steps to using `nuxt-content`: 1) configuring how you want your content data compiled and 2) dynamically using the content data inside Nuxt pages.

Nuxtent is to make using Nuxt for content heavy sites as easy as using Jekyll, Hugo, or any other static site generator.

It does in two main ways:

By compiling all the data from markdown or yaml files based on configured rules.
By providing helper methods for dynamically accessing this data inside Nuxt pages.
But, we didn't just want to make Nuxtent as good as a static site generator‚Äìwe wanted to make it better.

So, along with that, Nuxtent also supports:

The usage of content files in both static sites and dynamic applications.
The usage of async components inside markdown files.
There you go: four reasons to give Nuxtent a try, and maybe even star it and share it. üòè
